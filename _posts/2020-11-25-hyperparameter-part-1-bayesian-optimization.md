Tuning hyperparamter is a common problem of computer science. Moreover, it appears from theoretical models of machine leanring to hardware of computer systems. One of its popular applications is parameters tuning for neural networks. There are many optimization strategies, each of which is suitable and more effective for a specific problem. In this series, I will briefly introduce some algorithms, which is considered when I find a solution to optimize the profit of content delivery newtworks' owners. In more specific, I only consider non-gradient methods in this series.
